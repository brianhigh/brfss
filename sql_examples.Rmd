## SQL Examples: Smoking and Drinking

This is a demo of some basic SQL `SELECT` queries using BRFSS data from: 
http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/. We will also demonstrate use of `dbplyr` to perform 
queries for us, without our having to code the SQL statements ourselves.

We have downloaded the data for each respondent for the years 2012 through 2021. This dataset has 4,506,254 rows and 840 columns when [combined into a dataframe](get-brfss-data.md).

This dataset will be too large to fit in memory for most desktop and laptop 
computers. When this entire dataset is loaded into memory as an R dataframe, it consumes almost 30 GB of RAM. As of 2023, most workstations have only 16 GB of RAM or less.

Instead, we have [exported](download_brfss_into_duckdb.R) the data into a DuckDB database file. This allows access to just the data we need without loading all of it into memory at once. We have also limited the number of variables to only those present (359) in the first year's (2012) dataset.

The CDC has provided a 
[codebook](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2021/pdf/codebook21_llcp-v2-508.pdf) 
for use in understanding variables and codes. In particular, we will focus on tobacco use and alcohol consumption in 
the state of Washington.

## Setup

Load the required R packages, installing as needed.

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
if(!requireNamespace("pacman", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(knitr, dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr, stringr, ggh4x, duckdb, readr, httr)
```

Set `knitr` rendering options, the number of digits to display, and a palette.

```{r set_options, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
opts_chunk$set(tidy=FALSE, cache=FALSE, fig.height=3.5)
options(digits=4)
cbPalette <- c("#CC79A7", "#D55E00", "#999999", "#0072B2", "#009E73")
```

Connect to the DuckDB database file.

```{r message=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
ddb_fn <- file.path("data", "brfss_data.duckdb")
con <- duckdb::dbConnect(duckdb(), ddb_fn)
```

## Table Size

Print the number of rows and columns, as well as number of indexes.

```{r}
sql <- "SELECT COUNT(*) AS rows FROM brfss;"
rs <- dbGetQuery(con, sql)
cat(rs$rows, "row(s)")
sql <- "SELECT * FROM brfss LIMIT 1;"
rs <- dbGetQuery(con, sql)
cat(ncol(rs), "column(s)")
sql <- "select * from duckdb_indexes;"
rs <- dbGetQuery(con, sql)
cat(nrow(rs), "index(es)")
```

## Count Respondents by Year

Let's count (`COUNT`) the number of respondents per year (`GROUP BY`) in 
Washington state (`_STATE = 53`), sorting by year (`ORDER BY`).

```{r}
sql <- "SELECT IYEAR AS Year, COUNT(*) AS Respondents 
        FROM brfss 
        WHERE _STATE = 53 
        GROUP BY IYEAR 
        ORDER BY IYEAR;"
dbGetQuery(con, sql)
```

## Respondents per Education Level

Look at the number of respondents in 2021 and aggregate by education level.

```{r}
sql <- "SELECT _EDUCAG AS Education, COUNT(*) AS Respondents 
        FROM brfss 
        WHERE IYEAR = 2021 AND _STATE = 53 
        GROUP BY _EDUCAG 
        ORDER BY _EDUCAG;"
dbGetQuery(con, sql)
```

The education level (`_EDUCAG`) is an integer from 1-4 (or 9 meaning 
"Don't know", "Missing", etc.). Do we see a trend? Is our sample skewed?

## Count Smokers by Education Level

Use the `SMOKDAY2` variable to see if the survey respondent is
a "smoker" or not. A value of `1` (Every day) or `2` (Some days) means 
"is a smoker".

```{r}
sql <- "SELECT _EDUCAG AS Education, 
COUNT(SMOKDAY2) AS Smokers 
FROM brfss 
WHERE IYEAR = 2021 AND _STATE = 53 AND _EDUCAG <= 4 
AND (SMOKDAY2 IN (1, 2)) 
GROUP BY _EDUCAG 
ORDER BY _EDUCAG;"
dbGetQuery(con, sql)
```

The number of respondents varies by education level, so we will 
calculate "prevalence" as a fraction of respondents per education level.

## Count Smokers by Education Level

We can get a count of smokers and total respondents per education level in one 
query by using the `IF()` function within the `COUNT()` function.

```{r}
sql <- "SELECT _EDUCAG AS Education, 
COUNT(*) AS Respondents, 
COUNT(IF(SMOKDAY2 IN (1, 2), 1, NULL)) AS Smokers 
FROM brfss 
WHERE IYEAR = 2021 AND _STATE = 53 AND _EDUCAG <= 4 
GROUP BY _EDUCAG 
ORDER BY _EDUCAG;"
rs <- dbGetQuery(con, sql)
rs
```

The `IF()` condition `SMOKDAY2 IN (1, 2)` was taken from the `WHERE` 
clause. We had to make this change so that `COUNT(*)` counts all respondents.

## Smoking Prevalence by Education Level

We use functions from the `dplyr` package to calculate smoking prevalence. This
is the number of smokers as a fraction of respondents for each education level.

```{r message=FALSE}
smokers <- rs %>% group_by(Education) %>% 
  mutate(`Smoking Prevalence` = Smokers/Respondents)
smokers
```

## Relabel Education Level

Now, we relabel the codes for education level to meaningful text strings. We 
abbreviate the "Value Label" text descriptions from the codebook as follows.

```{r}
edu.labels <- c("some school", "high school grad", "some college", "college grad")
smokers$Education <- factor(smokers$Education, levels = 1:4, labels = edu.labels)
smokers
```

## Smoking Prevalence by Education Level

```{r message=FALSE}
ggplot(smokers, aes(x = Education, y = `Smoking Prevalence`, fill = Education)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

## Count Smokers by Education and Year

Let's compare smoking by year from 2012 to 2021. We will modify our prevalence 
calculation to exclude the "Don't Know/Refused/Missing" responses from the denominator.

```{r}
sql <- "SELECT IYEAR AS Year, _EDUCAG AS Education, 
COUNT(IF(SMOKDAY2 IN (1, 2), 1, NULL)) AS Smokers, 
COUNT(IF(SMOKDAY2 = 3, 1, NULL)) AS NonSmokers 
FROM brfss 
WHERE (IYEAR BETWEEN 2012 AND 2021)
AND _STATE = 53 
AND _EDUCAG <= 4 
GROUP BY IYEAR, _EDUCAG 
ORDER BY IYEAR, _EDUCAG DESC;"

rs <- dbGetQuery(con, sql)
smokers <- rs %>% group_by(Year, Education) %>% 
    mutate(`Smoking Prevalence` = Smokers/sum(Smokers, NonSmokers, na.rm = TRUE),
           Education = factor(Education, levels = 1:4, labels = edu.labels),
           Year = factor(Year))
```

## Smoking by Education and Year

```{r message=FALSE}
ggplot(smokers, aes(x = Year, y = `Smoking Prevalence`, 
                    color = Education, group = Education)) + geom_line()
```

## Smokers, Chewers, and Snuffers

`SMOKDAY2` represents smoking and `USENOW3` represents "chewing" or "snuffing".

```{r}
sql <- "SELECT IYEAR AS Year, _EDUCAG AS Education, 
COUNT(*) AS Respondents, 
COUNT(IF(SMOKDAY2 IN (1, 2), 1, NULL)) AS Smokers,
COUNT(IF(USENOW3 = 1 OR USENOW3 = 2, 1, NULL)) AS Chewers
FROM brfss 
WHERE (IYEAR BETWEEN 2012 AND 2021)
AND _STATE = 53 
AND _EDUCAG <= 4 
GROUP BY IYEAR, _EDUCAG 
ORDER BY IYEAR, _EDUCAG DESC;"

rs <- dbGetQuery(con, sql)
tobacco_use <- rs %>% group_by(Year, Education) %>% 
  mutate(Smokers = Smokers/Respondents, 
         `Chewers and Snuffers` = Chewers/Respondents) %>%
  mutate(Education = factor(Education, levels = 1:4, labels = edu.labels),
         Year = factor(Year)) %>% 
  select(-Respondents, -Chewers) %>%
  pivot_longer(c(-Year, -Education), names_to = "Type", values_to = "Prevalence")
```

## Smokers, Chewers, and Snuffers

```{r}
ggplot(tobacco_use, aes(x = Year, y = Prevalence, 
                        color = Education, group = Education)) + geom_line() + 
  ggh4x::facet_grid2(. ~ Type, scales = "free_y", independent = "y") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust = 1))
```

## 2021 Smoking & Vaping by Age & Sex

We will compare the proportion of smokers (`SMOKDAY2`) and e-cigarette (`ECIGNOW1`) 
or other electronic vaping product users ("vapers"), and those who are both, by 
age group (`_AGE_G`) and birth sex (`BIRTHSEX`) for 2021. 

Since `ECIGNOW1` is not available for previous years, and is not present in our
database's "brfss" table, we will use a different table (`brfss2021`) that was 
made by importing just the 2021 dataset from the BRFSS website.

```{r}
sql <- 'SELECT _AGE_G AS "Age Group", BIRTHSEX AS Gender, 
COUNT(*) AS Respondents, 
COUNT(IF(SMOKDAY2 IN (1, 2), 1, NULL)) AS Smokers,
COUNT(IF(ECIGNOW1 IN (1, 2), 1, NULL)) AS Vapers, 
COUNT(IF((SMOKDAY2 IN (1, 2)) AND (ECIGNOW1 IN (1, 2)), 1, NULL)) AS SmokeAndVapers, 
FROM brfss2021 WHERE IYEAR = 2021 AND (Gender IN (1, 2)) 
GROUP BY _AGE_G, BIRTHSEX ORDER BY _AGE_G, BIRTHSEX;'

rs <- dbGetQuery(con, sql)
```

## 2021 Smoking & Vaping by Age & Sex

Variables `_AGE_G` and `BIRTHSEX` are categorical, so apply labels with `factor()`. 

Reshape using `pivot_longer()` to store `Smoke`, `Vape`,and `Smoke and Vape` in `Factor` 
with values in `Prevalance`. This allows plotting by Factor in different colors.

```{r}
age.labels <- c('18-24', '25-34', '35-44', '45-54', '55-64', '65+')
consumers <- rs %>% group_by(`Age Group`, Gender) %>%
  mutate(`Smoke` = Smokers/Respondents,
         `Vape` = Vapers/Respondents,
         `Smoke or Vape` = sum(Smokers, Vapers, na.rm = TRUE)/Respondents,
         `Smoke and Vape` = SmokeAndVapers/Respondents,
         `Age Group` = factor(`Age Group`, levels = 1:6, labels = age.labels)) %>%
    pivot_longer(c(`Smoke`, `Vape`, `Smoke or Vape`, `Smoke and Vape`), 
                 names_to = "Factor", values_to = "Prevalence") %>%
  mutate(Gender = factor(Gender, levels = 2:1, labels = c("Female", "Male")))
```

## 2021 Smoking & Vaping by Age & Sex

```{r}
ggplot(consumers, aes(x = `Age Group`, y = `Prevalence`, 
                    color = Factor, group = Factor)) + 
  geom_line() + scale_color_manual(values = cbPalette) + facet_wrap(. ~ Gender) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust = 1))
```

## Count Drinkers by Education Level

The `DRNKANY5` variable stores a value indicating if the survey respondent has 
consumed an alcoholic drink in the past 30 days. We will use this value to 
indicate if the survey respondent is currently a "drinker" or not. A value of
`1` means "is a drinker". Again, we will just look at Washington state in 2021.

```{r}
sql <- "SELECT _EDUCAG AS Education, 
COUNT(*) AS Respondents, 
COUNT(IF(DRNKANY5 = 1, 1, NULL)) AS Drinkers 
FROM brfss 
WHERE IYEAR = 2021
AND _STATE = 53 
AND _EDUCAG <= 4 
GROUP BY _EDUCAG 
ORDER BY _EDUCAG DESC;"

rs <- dbGetQuery(con, sql)
```

## Drinking Prevalence by Education Level

Again, using `dplyr`, we can calculate drinking prevalence.

```{r}
drinkers <- rs %>% group_by(Education) %>% 
  mutate(`Drinking Prevalence` = Drinkers/Respondents,
         Education = factor(Education, levels = 1:4, labels = edu.labels))
drinkers
```

## Drinking Prevalence by Education Level

```{r}
ggplot(drinkers, aes(x = Education, y = `Drinking Prevalence`, fill = Education)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

## Count Drinkers by Education and Year

Let's see how drinking compares from 2012 to 2021. We will also
modify our prevalence calculation to exclude the "Don't Know/Refused/Missing" 
responses from the denominator.

```{r}
sql <- "SELECT IYEAR AS Year, _EDUCAG AS Education, 
COUNT(IF(DRNKANY5 = 1, 1, NULL)) AS Drinkers, 
COUNT(IF(DRNKANY5 = 2, 1, NULL)) AS NonDrinkers 
FROM brfss 
WHERE (IYEAR BETWEEN 2012 AND 2021)
AND _STATE = 53 
AND _EDUCAG <= 4 
GROUP BY IYEAR, _EDUCAG 
ORDER BY IYEAR, _EDUCAG DESC;"

rs <- dbGetQuery(con, sql)
drinkers <- rs %>% group_by(Year, Education) %>% 
    mutate(`Drinking Prevalence` = 
           Drinkers/sum(Drinkers, NonDrinkers, na.rm = TRUE),
           Education = factor(Education, levels = 1:4, labels = edu.labels))
```

## Drinking by Education and Year

```{r}
ggplot(drinkers, aes(x = Year, y = `Drinking Prevalence`, 
                     color = Education, group = Education)) + geom_line()
```

## Drinkers and Binge Drinkers

Let's compare drinkers (`DRNKANY5 = 1`) and binge drinkers (`_RFBING5 = 2`) 
for 2012-2021. Binge drinkers are defined as males having five or more drinks 
on one occasion and females having four or more drinks on one occasion.

```{r}
sql <- "SELECT IYEAR AS Year, _EDUCAG AS Education, 
COUNT(*) AS Respondents, 
COUNT(IF(DRNKANY5 = 1, 1, NULL)) AS Drinkers, 
COUNT(IF(DRNKANY5 = 2, 1, NULL)) AS NonDrinkers, 
COUNT(IF(_RFBING5 = 2, 1, NULL)) AS BingeDrinkers, 
COUNT(IF(_RFBING5 = 1, 1, NULL)) AS NonBingeDrinkers 
FROM brfss 
WHERE (IYEAR BETWEEN 2012 AND 2021)
AND _STATE = 53 
AND _EDUCAG <= 4 
GROUP BY IYEAR, _EDUCAG 
ORDER BY IYEAR, _EDUCAG DESC;"
```

## Drinkers and Binge Drinkers

As before, we will exclude the "Don't Know/Refused/Missing" 
responses from the denominator in our our prevalence calculations.

```{r}
rs <- dbGetQuery(con, sql)
drinkers <- rs %>% group_by(Year, Education) %>% 
  mutate(Drinkers = 
           Drinkers/sum(Drinkers, NonDrinkers, na.rm = TRUE),
         `Binge Drinkers` = 
           BingeDrinkers/sum(BingeDrinkers, NonBingeDrinkers, na.rm = TRUE),
         Education = factor(Education, levels = 1:4, labels = edu.labels)) %>% 
  select(Year, Education, Drinkers, `Binge Drinkers`) %>%
  pivot_longer(c(-Year, -Education), names_to = "Type", values_to = "Prevalence")
```

## Drinkers and Binge Drinkers

```{r}
ggplot(drinkers, aes(x = Year, y = Prevalence, 
                     color = Education, group = Education)) + geom_line() + 
  ggh4x::facet_grid2(. ~ Type, scales = "free_y", independent = "y") +  
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust = 1))
```

## Smoking and Drinking Prevalence

Prepare prevalence data as before, but reshape to allow faceting by risk factor.

```{r}
sql <- "SELECT IYEAR AS Year, _EDUCAG AS Education, 
COUNT(IF(SMOKDAY2 IN (1, 2), 1, NULL)) AS Smokers, 
COUNT(IF(SMOKDAY2 = 3, 1, NULL)) AS NonSmokers,
COUNT(IF(DRNKANY5 = 1, 1, NULL)) AS Drinkers,
COUNT(IF(DRNKANY5 = 2, 1, NULL)) AS NonDrinkers
FROM brfss 
WHERE (IYEAR BETWEEN 2012 AND 2021) AND _STATE = 53 AND _EDUCAG <= 4 
GROUP BY IYEAR, _EDUCAG 
ORDER BY IYEAR, _EDUCAG;"

consumers <- dbGetQuery(con, sql) %>% 
  group_by(Year, Education) %>% 
  mutate(Smoking = Smokers/sum(Smokers, NonSmokers, na.rm = TRUE), 
         Drinking = Drinkers/sum(Drinkers, NonDrinkers, na.rm = TRUE),
         Education = factor(Education, levels = 1:4, labels = edu.labels)) %>%
  select(Year, Education, Smoking, Drinking) %>%
  pivot_longer(c(Smoking, Drinking), 
               names_to = "Factor", values_to = "Prevalence")
```

## Smoking and Drinking Prevalence

```{r}
ggplot(consumers, aes(x = Year, y = Prevalence, group = Factor, color = Factor)) + 
    geom_line() + facet_grid(Factor ~ Education, scales = "free_y") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) + 
    scale_color_manual(values = cbPalette)
```

## Alternative to Writing SQL

Wouldn't it be nice to do this in R without having to write SQL too? 

You can use the `dbplyr` package, which will automatically load if `dplyr` 
is loaded, to translate R code to SQL for you. This allows you to use R
code instead if SQL to get your data from the database.

```{r}
brfss_data <- tbl(con, "brfss")
result <- brfss_data %>% 
  select("Year" = IYEAR, "Education" = `_EDUCAG`, State = `_STATE`, 
         SMOKDAY2, DRNKANY5) %>%
  filter(Year >= 2012, Year <= 2021, State == 53, Education <= 4)
```

Don't do too much cleanup here, though. Just focus on selecting and filtering
the data to minimize how much to read from the database. Cleanup comes later. 
The reason is that complex `dbplyr` queries can be slow and are more prone to 
error.

## View the SQL Query

While this didn't actually execute the query and return the dataset, it did
create a SQL query that we'll use next.

```{r}
result %>% show_query()
```

## Prepare Data for Plotting

To actually execute the SQL query, we use `collect()`. Then we perform the same steps as we did previously on the SQL query results, but using R instead of a mix of R and SQL.

```{r}
consumers <- collect(result) %>% 
  mutate(Smoker = ifelse(SMOKDAY2 %in% 1:2, 1, 0)) %>% 
  mutate(NonSmoker = ifelse(SMOKDAY2 == 3, 1, 0)) %>% 
  mutate(Drinker = ifelse(DRNKANY5 == 1, 1, 0)) %>% 
  mutate(NonDrinker = ifelse(DRNKANY5 == 2, 1, 0)) %>% 
  group_by(Year, Education) %>% 
  summarize(
    Smoking = sum(Smoker, na.rm = TRUE)/sum(Smoker, NonSmoker, na.rm = TRUE),
    Drinking = sum(Drinker, na.rm = TRUE)/sum(Drinker, NonDrinker, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "keep") %>% 
  mutate(Education = factor(Education, levels = 1:4, labels = edu.labels)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(Smoking, Drinking), 
               names_to = "Factor", values_to = "Prevalence")
```

## Plot dbplyr Results

```{r}
# Use the same ggplot() command as before
ggplot(consumers, aes(x = Year, y = Prevalence, group = Factor, color = Factor)) + 
    geom_line() + facet_grid(Factor ~ Education, scales = "free_y") + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) + 
    scale_color_manual(values = cbPalette)
```

## 2021 Drinking Amount by Age and Sex

Using `dbplyr`, compare drinking frequency (`ALCDAY5`) and amount 
(`AVEDRNK3`) by age group and sex at birth (`BIRTHSEX`) in 2021. Exclude 
non-drinkers.

```{r}
drinkers <- tbl(con, "brfss2021") %>% 
  select("Year" = IYEAR, "Age Group" = `_AGE_G`, DRNKANY5, 
         "Gender" = BIRTHSEX, ALCDAY5, AVEDRNK3) %>%
  filter(Year == 2021, DRNKANY5 == 1, Gender %in% 1:2) %>% collect(result) %>%
  mutate(DaysPerMonth = 
           case_when(ALCDAY5 >= 101 & ALCDAY5 <= 107 ~ (ALCDAY5 - 100) * (30/7),
                     ALCDAY5 >= 201 & ALCDAY5 <= 230 ~ ALCDAY5 - 200,
                     .default = 0)) %>% 
  mutate(DrinksPerDay = 
           case_when(AVEDRNK3 >= 1 & AVEDRNK3 <= 76 ~ AVEDRNK3,
                     .default = 0)) %>% 
  mutate(DrinksPerMonth = DrinksPerDay * DaysPerMonth) %>% 
  group_by(Gender, `Age Group`) %>% 
  summarize(across(c(DrinksPerDay, DrinksPerMonth), ~ mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE)),
            .groups = "drop") %>% 
  mutate(`Age Group` = factor(`Age Group`, levels = 1:6, labels = age.labels),
         Gender = factor(Gender, levels = 2:1, labels = c("Female", "Male")))
```

## 2021 Drinking Amount by Age and Sex

```{r}
ggplot(drinkers, aes(x = `Age Group`, y = DrinksPerMonth, color = Gender)) + 
  geom_point(aes(size = DrinksPerDay)) + ylab("Drinks per Month (30 days)") + 
  guides(color = guide_legend(title = "Sex at Birth"),
         size = guide_legend(title = "Drinks per \nDrinking Day"))
```

## Speeding up Queries

If we retrieve all of the data for Washington state respondents for 2012-2021,
we can just use R commands for subsetting and work entirely from memory.

```{r message=FALSE}
# Get all Washington State data from 2012-2021 from database as a dataframe
brfss_data <- tbl(con, "brfss")
result <- brfss_data %>% 
  filter(IYEAR >= 2012, IYEAR <= 2021, `_STATE` == 53)
brfsswa1221 <- collect(result)
dim(brfsswa1221)

# Remove 100 columns that contain only NA , zero (0), or the empty string ('')
brfsswa1221 <- brfsswa1221 %>% select_if(~ !(all(is.na(.) | . == 0 | . == "")))
dim(brfsswa1221)
```

## Check on Memory, Write to File

We will compare the size of the dataset in memory (RAM) and as a file (RDS).

```{r}
# Report data table size and dimensions
cat("The data table consumes", object.size(brfsswa1221) / 1024^2, "MB", 
    "with", dim(brfsswa1221)[1], "observations and", 
    dim(brfsswa1221)[2], "variables", "\n")

# Save as a RDS and check on the size
filename <- file.path("data", "brfsswa1221.rds")
if (! file.exists(filename)) saveRDS(brfsswa1221, filename)
cat(paste(c("Size of RDS file is", 
            round(file.size(filename) / 1024^2, 1), "MB", "\n")))
```

In the future, if we only want to work with Washington State data from 2012-2021, then we can just read from the RDS file instead of using the Duck DB database.

## Reproduce Results without SQL

We can test our subset by reproducing our SQL query with R commands as before.

```{r message=FALSE}
consumers <- brfsswa1221 %>%
  select("Year" = IYEAR, "Education" = `_EDUCAG`, State = `_STATE`, 
         SMOKDAY2, DRNKANY5) %>%
  filter(Year >= 2012, Year <= 2021, State == 53, Education <= 4) %>% 
  mutate(Smoker = ifelse(SMOKDAY2 %in% 1:2, 1, 0)) %>% 
  mutate(NonSmoker = ifelse(SMOKDAY2 == 3, 1, 0)) %>% 
  mutate(Drinker = ifelse(DRNKANY5 == 1, 1, 0)) %>% 
  mutate(NonDrinker = ifelse(DRNKANY5 == 2, 1, 0)) %>% 
  group_by(Year, Education) %>% 
  summarize(
    Smoking = sum(Smoker, na.rm = TRUE)/sum(Smoker, NonSmoker, na.rm = TRUE),
    Drinking = sum(Drinker, na.rm = TRUE)/sum(Drinker, NonDrinker, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "keep") %>% 
  mutate(Education = factor(Education, levels = 1:4, labels = edu.labels)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(Smoking, Drinking), 
               names_to = "Factor", values_to = "Prevalence")
```

## Smoking and Drinking Prevalence

```{r}
# Use the same ggplot() command as used earlier

## Compare States: Get FIPS Codes

We can easily compare states if we know the codes used in the BRFSS dataset. The
codes are known as [FIPS codes](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/1996/files/fipscode.txt). We can 
lookup the FIPS code for Pacific Northwest (PNW) states like this:

```{r}
# Get a table of state FIPS codes and state names
fips_fn <- file.path("data", "fips.csv")
if (! file.exists(fips_fn)) {
  url <- "https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/1996/files/fipscode.txt"
  GET(url) %>% content("text", encoding = "UTF-8") %>% 
    str_replace_all('\\r\\n', '\n') %>% 
    read_fwf(skip = 3, n_max = 51, col_types = c("i", "c"), 
                 col_positions = fwf_widths(c(12, NA))) %>%
    rename("state_fips" = X1, "state_name" = X2) %>% 
    mutate(state_name = str_to_title(state_name)) %>%
    mutate(state_name = str_replace(state_name, " Of ", " of ")) %>% 
    write_csv(fips_fn)
}

# Import data and create a vector of PNW state FIPS codes to use for filtering
fips <- read_csv(fips_fn, col_types = c('i', 'c'))
pnw_states <- c("Alaska", "Idaho", "Montana", "Oregon", "Washington")
pnw_state_fips <- fips %>% filter(state_name %in% pnw_states) %>% pull(state_fips)
```

## Compare States: Count Respondents

To see these FIPS codes used in action, let's count the number of respondents 
per PNW state for the 2012-2021 timespan.

```{r}
brfss_data <- tbl(con, "brfss")

result <- brfss_data %>% rename(State = `_STATE`, "Year" = IYEAR) %>% 
  filter(State %in% pnw_state_fips, Year >= 2012, Year <= 2021) %>%
  group_by(State) %>% summarize(N = n()) %>% arrange(desc(N))

inner_join(fips, collect(result), by = c('state_fips' = 'State'))
```

## Compare States: Prep for Plot

```{r}
brfss_data <- tbl(con, "brfss")

result <- brfss_data %>% 
  select("Year" = IYEAR, "Education" = `_EDUCAG`, State = `_STATE`, 
         SMOKDAY2, DRNKANY5) %>%
  filter(Year >= 2012, Year <= 2021, Education <= 4, State %in% pnw_state_fips)

consumers <- collect(result) %>% 
  mutate(Smoker = ifelse(SMOKDAY2 %in% 1:2, 1, 0)) %>% 
  mutate(NonSmoker = ifelse(SMOKDAY2 == 3, 1, 0)) %>% 
  mutate(Drinker = ifelse(DRNKANY5 == 1, 1, 0)) %>% 
  mutate(NonDrinker = ifelse(DRNKANY5 == 2, 1, 0)) %>% 
  group_by(Year, State, Education) %>% 
  summarize(
    Smoking = sum(Smoker, na.rm = TRUE)/sum(Smoker, NonSmoker, na.rm = TRUE),
    Drinking = sum(Drinker, na.rm = TRUE)/sum(Drinker, NonDrinker, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "keep") %>% 
  mutate(Education = factor(Education, levels = 1:4, labels = edu.labels)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(Smoking, Drinking), 
               names_to = "Factor", values_to = "Prevalence") %>%
  inner_join(fips, by = c('State' = 'state_fips')) %>% 
  mutate(State = state_name) %>% select(-state_name)
```

## Compare States: Plot

```{r}
# Use the same ggplot() command as before, modified to color by state
ggplot(consumers, aes(x = Year, y = Prevalence, group = State, color = State)) + 
    geom_line() + facet_grid(Factor ~ Education, scales = "free_y") + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) + 
    scale_color_manual(values = cbPalette)
```

## Smoking and Drinking by State and Age

Age group (`_AGE_G`) is a 6-level ordinal variable. Apply labels with `factor()`.

```{r}
age.labels <- c('18-24', '25-34', '35-44', '45-54', '55-64', '65+')
consumers <- tbl(con, "brfss") %>% 
  select("Year" = IYEAR, "Age Group" = `_AGE_G`, State = `_STATE`, 
         SMOKDAY2, DRNKANY5) %>%
  filter(Year >= 2012, Year <= 2021, State %in% pnw_state_fips) %>% 
  collect() %>% 
  mutate(Smoker = ifelse(SMOKDAY2 %in% 1:2, 1, 0)) %>% 
  mutate(NonSmoker = ifelse(SMOKDAY2 == 3, 1, 0)) %>% 
  mutate(Drinker = ifelse(DRNKANY5 == 1, 1, 0)) %>% 
  mutate(NonDrinker = ifelse(DRNKANY5 == 2, 1, 0)) %>% 
  group_by(State, `Age Group`) %>% 
  summarize(
    Smoking = sum(Smoker, na.rm = TRUE)/sum(Smoker, NonSmoker, na.rm = TRUE),
    Drinking = sum(Drinker, na.rm = TRUE)/sum(Drinker, NonDrinker, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "keep") %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(Smoking, Drinking), 
               names_to = "Factor", values_to = "Prevalence") %>%
  inner_join(fips, by = c('State' = 'state_fips')) %>% 
  mutate(State = state_name) %>% select(-state_name) %>%
  mutate(`Age Group` = factor(`Age Group`, levels = 1:6, labels = age.labels))
```

## Smoking and Drinking by State and Age

Plot drinking and smoking prevalence by age group and state for 2012-2021.

```{r}
ggplot(consumers, 
       aes(x = `Age Group`, y = Prevalence, group = State, color = State)) + 
  geom_line() + facet_grid(. ~ Factor)
```

## Compare other Variables

Now that you know how to query the database, compare other variables, such as:

- Smoking and drinking with income (`_INCOMG`) or race (`_RACE`)
- Smoking and drinking with cholesterol (`_RFCHOL3`) or heart disease (`_MICHD`) 
- BMI category (`_BMI5CAT`) and exercise (`EXERANY2`) or sleep (`SLEPTIM1`)
- Health care access (`HLTHPLN1`) and household income (`INCOME2`)
- Stress (`QLSTRES2`) and marital status (`MARITAL`)
- Internet use (`INTERNET`) and mental health (`MENTHLTH`) 
- Life satisfaction (`LSATISFY`) and social/emotional support (`EMTSUPRT)`
- What are *you* curious about?

## Close Database Connection

Once we are done with the database, we can close the connection to it.

```{r}
# Close connection
dbDisconnect(con, shutdown = TRUE)
```

### What if I forget?

If you forget to close the connection, you will get an error if you try to reopen it.

```
Failed to open database: IO Error: 
Could not set lock on file "data/brfss_data.duckdb": 
Resource temporarily unavailable
```

### Write-Ahead-Log (`.wal`) Files

If you close your R session without first closing the connection, a `.wal` file 
may be left behind, preventing new connections. In that case, you could remove 
this file manually. Otherwise, R will cleanup that file for you after you close 
your connection with `dbDisconnect()`.
